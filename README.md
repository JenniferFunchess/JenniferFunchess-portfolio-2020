Description

It is finally that time in my career to create an online portfolio. This exercise called for creating from scratch an online portfolio which is made up of three different HTML sheets and a style.css document. 

The process I took to create my online portfolio is first creating three HTML documents. Once I had my navigation bar, sticky footer and background completed on the Index.html (home) page, I was able to create a CSS sheet and make sure all three web browsers are identical. Once I uploaded everything the webpages have in common, it was time to personalize each one. I added a personal photo and an "About Me" section to the main page. I added a contact form to the Contact page. Lastly, I added stand in portfolio pictures to the portfolio page. Once I completed the documents, I went through to make sure all div tags were updated to semantic tags and all the HTML code was validated. 

It is important to be able to create an online website to look identical to the client's design request. If we are able to examine a design, create the code from scratch and be able to push the website live, we are on our ways to becoming web developers! 

Potential future projects for this website would be to add links to each of the portfolio pics and to add java elements to the website as well.
